This is a simple countdown program that accepts a user input (number) then checks if the number is greater than 0,
then prints the number, then minus the number with 1. Then goes again until our number is no longer greater than 0,
so if my input was 4, my output would be 4, 3, 2, 1.

I also added a while loop by creating a countup method
- first i createc s scanner class that accept an interger value
then i assigned it go a variable num2
- create a new count variable age it a value 1.
