This is a simple countdown program that accepts a user input (number) then checks if the number is greater than 0,
then prints the number, then minus the number with 1. Then goes again until our number is no longer greater than 0,
so if my input was 4, my output would be 4, 3, 2, 1.

I also added a while loop by creating a countup method
- first i created a scanner class that acceps an interger value
then i assigned it go a variable num2
- create a new count variable and gave it a value of 1. while the new variable count .
- is less < that or = equals( num2 that was the variabkr i assigned to the user inout ).
- then i printed the count variable and did count ++, it'll count up , so if my input was 4 , my output would be 1, 2, 3, 4.
